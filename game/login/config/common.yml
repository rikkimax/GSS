# A list of classes which will be serialized into the database.
SerializedClasses:
    - gss.eventing.UnknownEvent
    - gss.queueing.TestQueue
# Queues list of classes acts like SerializedClasses list but..
# these have the added feature of being a queue as well.
# If you want to add classes to handle it use the events system or set the primary event..
# With list item with .class at end for event system.
queues:
    # queue class: queue handler (none for event system)
    gss.queueing.TestQueue: gss.eventing.UnknownEvent
events:
    # Provides a list of event triggors and there event classes
    # gss.eventing.UnknownEvent.class: # We use an object, class or a String here! But Strings need to be enclosed in ""
        # - gss.eventing.UnknownEvent # This class does nothing.. not really needed but good as an example
